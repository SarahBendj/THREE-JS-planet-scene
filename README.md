# THREE-JS-planet-scene

Quick & simple scene that represents ( earth motion ) (which is physically incorrect but still fun)

## Did you know that 
The Earth is tilted on its axis by approximately 23.5 degrees(approxiamtly, yes it does change), contributing to the changing seasons.

Earth's orbit around the sun is elliptical, following Kepler's laws, and it has two foci, influencing its motion in space.

During summer, Earth is farthest from the sun, coinciding with the aphelion, where it reaches its maximum distance from the sun in its elliptical orbit.
